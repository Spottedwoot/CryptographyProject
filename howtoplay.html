          <h2>How To Play</h2>
          <p>
            The encryption game has 2 main portions: encryption and decryption. 
            The purpose of the game is to show you why encryption works by displaying 
            the reason why it is hard to break an encryption, but not hard if you know 
            the key. Modern encryption uses the fact that it is significantly easier to take the 
            product of two primes then to find the 2 unique prime factors of a large number. So in 
            the encryption portion of the game you will be given 2 primes and need to find (p-1)(q-1), which
            is the value that is used to decrypt text. For the decryption you will be given a number that 
            factors into two prime numbers p and q and will need to find (p-1)(q-1). You will find that the
            decryption is significantly harder than the encryption. In the sandbox you will be able to type in whatever text you want
            and encrypt it and then take the encrypted text and decrypt it. Have fun!
          </p>
          
          <h2>How Encryption Works</h2>
          <p> The way encryption works is it starts with two people. Let's call them Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob want
            to communicate and so they both choose 2 large primes each p<sub>A</sub> and q<sub>A</sub> for Alice and p<sub>B</sub> and q<sub>B</sub> for Bob and keep them secret. Then they will both choose a number e<sub>A</sub> for Alice,
            and e<sub>B</sub> for Bob. Then Alice will publish N<sub>A</sub>=p<sub>A</sub>q<sub>A</sub> and e<sub>A</sub> while Bob will publish N<sub>B</sub>=p<sub>B</sub>q<sub>B</sub> and e<sub>B</sub>. Now let's say Alice wants to send a message to Bob. Alice
            will first convert her message to Bob to a number, m. She will then compute the remainder of m<sup>e<sub>B</sub></sup> when divided by N<sub>B</sub>. This may seem like a daunting task given that calculating powers of a number is hard 
            but in practice there are many tricks to calculate this remainder fast so that when a computer does it, it becomes about as hard as calculating m<sup>k</sup> where k is about log<sub>2</sub>(e<sub>B</sub>). This means that even for relatively big e<sub>B</sub> calculating 
            this remainder doesn't get too bad. Now Alice will send that remainder, c, to Bob. Then Bob will find a d such that when he divides d*e<sub>B</sub> by (p<sub>B</sub>-1)(q<sub>B</sub>-1) he gets a remainder of 1. This while also looking hard to solve, is not very difficult for
            a computer to do. Finally Bob will compute the remainder of c<sup>d</sup> when divided by N<sub>B</sub> and that will get him back the original m. This fact is not obvious and takes some effort to prove but that is outside of the scope of this game.

          <h2>The Math</h2>
          <p>
          At the heart of this process is the idea of a congruence. A congruence is an equation of the form a â‰… b (mod n). What this is saying is that when you divide a by n and b by n you get the same remainder. Congruences are fun to work with because
          they behave very nicely. Like regular equations you can add, subtract, and multiply on both sides, but be careful about division because divsion only works if the number you are dividing by and n don't share any factors. Something nice about congruences is that if you
          have a â‰… b (mod n) then a*a â‰… b*b (mod n). This is why taking the remainder of m<sup>e<sub>B</sub></sup> divided by N<sub>B</sub> is not that bad because you only have to care about the remainder after each step of the computation. Another one of the main theorems about congruences
            that is very important in the proof that Bob actually gets back the message is Fermat's Little Theorem. This says that a<sup>p-1</sup> â‰… 1 (mod p) if p is prime. This is, at least in my opinion, an unituitive result that you would have never thought of if you only thought of remainders in division
          rather than fully considering congruences. Congruences are used all over number theory
          and are able to be used to show facts that you might think have very little to do with them. As you have read about previously, in the real world congruences are mostly just used in cryptography. The algorithm described above is just one of many and a lot of the encryption algoritms use
          congruences in some way.
